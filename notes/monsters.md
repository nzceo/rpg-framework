### Rules

Waistline increase should never be too ridiculous.

25/30 inches at max (for multiples etc), 35 tops at a stretch in special occasions (ogre pregnancy).

Weight should never be more than 13/15 pounds and it should scale down with multiples.

### Human

Normal stuff.

#### Singleton

Average length, average size most of the time.

```
{
  "progressDays": 270,
  "waist": "41.73in(+16.39in)",
  "weight": "157.05lb(+17.70lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "8.67"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "8.67"
}
```

#### Twins

Human twins have shorter gestation and they're usually smaller.

```
{
  "progressDays": 259,
  "waist": "54.82in(+29.95in)",
  "weight": "157.97lb(+22.58lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "6.90",
    "6.57"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "13.48"
}
```

#### Triplets

Triplets are incredibly rare, but they can happen. While their weights are much smaller than a single or twins and the gestation time is much shorter, it still results in a massive pregnancy.

```
{
  "progressDays": 254,
  "waist": "66.06in(+40.99in)",
  "weight": "166.41lb(+27.57lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "6.10",
    "5.83",
    "6.19"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "18.13"
}
```

### Orc

Babies tend to be bigger and heavier than a human's. Same growth pattern as humans (?).

Found in mountaneous areas, some are civilised and friendly although many breakoff groups exist outside of mountains.

#### Singleton

A normal orc fetus is the size of a very big human's.

```
{
  "progressDays": 274,
  "waist": "48.90in(+23.79in)",
  "weight": "161.55lb(+22.13lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "12.95"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "12.95"
}
```

#### Twins

Orc twins are rare as they result in a difficult pregnancy.

Gestational length remains unchanged, and both fetuses are not much smaller than a single one.

```
{
  "progressDays": 270,
  "waist": "54.59in(+29.50in)",
  "weight": "162.71lb(+26.10lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "8.57",
    "8.51"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "17.07"
}
```

### Goblins

While much smaller than a human's, they usually have multiples. Triplets are the norm. Found almost everywhere.

#### Triples

Multiples are the norm for Goblins, thankfully they're quite small.

```
{
  "progressDays": 271,
  "waist": "44.80in(+19.78in)",
  "weight": "160.66lb(+22.55lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "4.73",
    "4.55",
    "4.20"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "13.48"
}
```

#### Quadruplets

While gestation is shorter, goblins mostly stay the same size.

```
{
  "progressDays": 259,
  "waist": "46.96in(+22.33in)",
  "weight": "166.26lb(+26.81lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "4.41",
    "4.35",
    "4.50",
    "4.45"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "17.70"
}
```

#### Quintuplets

Quintuplets are not that rare and fetuses mostly stay the same size. Thankfully they're still much smaller than all other monsters.

```
{
  "progressDays": 235,
  "waist": "49.57in(+24.10in)",
  "weight": "166.70lb(+26.31lb)",
  "eachBabyWeight": [
    "3.65",
    "3.54",
    "3.59",
    "3.45",
    "3.39"
  ],
  "totalBabyWeight": "17.63"
}
```

### Minotaurs

Bigger and heavier than an orc. Very active.

An endangered species, difficult to find in the wild. Slavers love to keep minotaurs around.

### Horse people

Big and heavy, gestation is about a year. They reach their final size at around 9 months, extra gestational time is spent developing their brains so they are self sufficient once out.

Because of their rather short lifespans, they live in small agricultural villages. Known to be very fond of drinking.

### Tieflings

?

### Succubi

?

### Pig people?

?

### Oni

Huge creature, huge offspring. Gestation time varies between 9 months and a year, depending on what the mother's body can take.

Offspring can be as big as 3x the size of a human.
