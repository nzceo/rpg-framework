# Belly

- shockingly distended belly
- taut straining mound
- huge round abdomen
- outstretched tummy X
- full round expanse of your belly mound
- distended abdomen
- the vast, ripe boulder of your straining abdomen
- heavily parturient figure
- the extreme roundness of your tummy
- outstanding bowl of your belly
- belly so extremely swollen and thrust out before your
- enormous mound X
- the huge curves of your swollen womb
- straining uterus X
- tightly stretched tummy
- great globe of your belly
- how thin and tense was the sheet of enormously stretched abdominal skin
- overripe belly X
- straining milky white globe
- bulging womb
- great shiny taut belly
- your huge belly now hung, tightly defined, from your back, heavily curved from the weight it suspended
- impossibly stretched skin of your poor overburdened tummy
- settled heavy, round, and very low into your hips like a hugely overripe fruit
- straining and bulging against your clothes
- your back bowed by the weight of the great balled tummy hanging beneath you
- your tender uterus pressing heavily on the sheet of muscle supporting your baby
- low hanging tummy
- hard, round tummy
- thin walls of her over-full womb
- great taut mass of her straining abdomen
- your tummy, so tightly stretched by your child
- tightly packed womb
- huge, taut and low hanging

# Belly button

- the thinly drawn skin around your down tilted belly button
- outthrust navel poking shamelessly through the fabric
- a stretched hard lump at the very center of this enormous, thrusting boulder

# Walking

- belly swaying ponderously from side to side
- heavily and awkwardly walking
- you lumbered carefully you back bent to balance your huge
- huge belly swaying awkwardly with each waddling step
- awkward, wide legged gait of a heavily gravid woman

# Contraction

- Like a sheet of burning pain your abdominal muscles clamped and fisted tight around your baby burden
- tightly stretched tummy muscles
- clutching the side of your huge
- firmness and tension of your overstretched muscular walls X
- tightening of your uterus
- your back is suddenly aflame
- a searing band of pain flaring around the widest part of your outstretched tummy X
- the white hot ring of fire tightening around your uterus
- your fingers ran over the aching sheet of muscle clasping your womb feeling how firm and tight it became over the bony limbs of your child
- agonising band of pain across the low swell of your abdomen X
- cupping with both both hands the broad expance of your aching lower belly
- a deep cramping grips you
- a cramp rippled around your tightly packed womb making it stand out, hard and sore
- your hands cupped your aching belly

# Pressure

- the pressure of your babe deep between your hips is intense
