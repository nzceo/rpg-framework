### Todo

- should probably improve birth event a bit further, doesn't work great with multiples
- Improve dialog system to make it so that not all options start with "Talk to"
- Write quests involving combat?
- More randomness to baby weights?
- body weight should also include like a 10% of your body weight + randomness factor
- waist with multiples is completely fucked
  - this might be caused by the randomiser + the curves post term
