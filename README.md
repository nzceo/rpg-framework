# RPG Framework

This is a for-fun project, I don't actually expect it to be finished and probably shouldn't be used in production.

The aim of this repo is to create a template for a highly customiseable (text-based or not) RPG. It's entirely framework agnostic and should (theoretically) work with any front-end.

It aims to create basic functionality and make it extendable by overriding certain defaults.

## Text-based / Visual

By default this repo only deals with data and text, but exactly because it has been kept so basic it **should** also work when trying to make a non text-based project.

⚠️ TODO: Add examples
